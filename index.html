            <h2>About Bonsai trees</h2>
            <p>Bonsai (<span title="literally &quot;tray planting&quot;">盆栽</span>) is the Japanese art of growing and shaping miniature trees in containers, with a long documented history of influences and native Japanese development over a thousand years, with unique aesthetics, cultural history, and terminology derived from its evolution in Japan.</p>
            <p>Purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation for the viewer, as well as the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity for the grower. In contrast to other plant cultivation practices, bonsai are not grown for the production of food or for medicinal purposes.</p>

            <h2>Material Sources</h2>
            <p>All bonsai start with a specimen of source material, a plant that the grower wishes to train into bonsai form. Bonsai practice is an unusual form of plant cultivation in the sense that growth from seeds is rarely used to obtain source material. To display the characteristic aged appearance of a bonsai within a reasonable time, the source plant is often mature or at least partially grown when the bonsai creator begins work. Sources of bonsai material include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Propagation from a source tree through cuttings or layering.</li>
                <li>Nursery stock directly from a nursery, or from a garden centre or similar resale establishment.</li>
                <li>Commercial bonsai growers, which, in general, sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already.</li>
                <li>Collecting suitable bonsai material in its original wild situation, successfully moving it, and replanting it in a container for development as bonsai. These trees are called <em>yamadori</em> and are often the most expensive and prized of all bonsai.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <p>The practice of bonsai development incorporates a number of techniques either unique to bonsai or, if used in other forms of cultivation, applied in unusual ways that are particularly suitable to the bonsai domain. The main  techniques include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Leaf trimming, the selective removal of leaves or needles from a bonsai's trunk and branches.</li>
                <li>Pruning the trunk, branches, and roots of the tree.</li>
                <li>Wiring branches and trunks - this allows the bonsai designer to create the desired general form and make detailed branch and leaf placements.</li>
                <li>Clamping using mechanical devices for shaping trunks and branches; bending of branches or trunks may also be achieved by the use of tension cables or guy-wires.</li>
                <li>Grafting new growing material (typically a bud, branch, or root) into a prepared area on the trunk or under the bark of the tree.</li>
                <li>Defoliation, which can provide short-term dwarfing of foliage for certain deciduous species.</li>
                <li>Deadwood bonsai techniques such as <em>jin</em> and <em>shari</em> simulate age and maturity in a bonsai.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>Bonsai aesthetics are the aesthetic goals characterizing the Japanese tradition of growing an artistically shaped miniature tree in a container. Many Japanese cultural characteristics, in particular the influence of Zen Buddhism and the expression of wabi-sabi, influence the bonsai tradition in Japan. Established art forms that share some aesthetic principles with bonsai include <em>penjing</em> and <em>saikei</em>. A number of other cultures around the globe have adopted the Japanese aesthetic approach to bonsai, and, while some variations have begun to appear, most adhere closely to the rules and design philosophies of the Japanese tradition.</p>
            <p>Over centuries of practice, the Japanese bonsai aesthetic has embodied some important techniques and design guidelines. Like the aesthetic rules that govern, for example, Western common practice period music, bonsai's guidelines help practitioners work within an established tradition with some assurance of success. Simply following the guidelines alone will not guarantee a successful result. Nevertheless, these design rules can rarely be broken without reducing the impact of the bonsai specimen. Some key principles in bonsai aesthetics include:</p>
            <div class="flex-list">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Miniaturization:</strong> By definition, a bonsai is a tree kept small enough to be container-grown while otherwise fostered to have a mature appearance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proportion among elements:</strong> The most prized proportions mimic those of a full-grown tree as closely as possible. Small trees with large leaves or needles are out of proportion and are avoided, as is a thin trunk with thick branches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> Bonsai aesthetics discourage strict radial or bilateral symmetry in branch and root placement.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No trace of the artist:</strong> The designer's touch must not be apparent to the viewer. If a branch is removed in shaping the tree, the scar must be concealed. Likewise, wiring should be removed or at least concealed when the bonsai is shown, and must leave no permanent marks on the branch or the bark.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poignancy:</strong> Many of the formal rules of bonsai help the grower create a tree that expresses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi" target="_blank"><em>Wabi-sabi</em></a>, or portrays an aspect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware" target="_blank"><em>mono no aware</em></a>.</li>
                </ul>
